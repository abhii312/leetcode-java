Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Algorithm)
📌 Problem Summary

Given an array nums containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array in-place so that:

All 0s come first

Then all 1s

Then all 2s

You must solve this without using built-in sort.

💡 Approach Used: Three Pointers (Dutch National Flag)

We divide the array into four logical regions using three pointers:

low → boundary for 0s

mid → current element under evaluation

high → boundary for 2s

Invariant at any time:
[0 ... low-1]     → 0s
[low ... mid-1]   → 1s
[mid ... high]    → unknown
[high+1 ... end]  → 2s

class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {

        // Pointer for the next position of 0
        int low = 0;

        // Pointer for current element
        int mid = 0;

        // Pointer for the next position of 2
        int high = nums.length - 1;

        // Process elements until mid crosses high
        while (mid <= high) {

            // Case 1: Current element is 0
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {

                // Swap with element at 'low'
                int temp = nums[mid];
                nums[mid] = nums[low];
                nums[low] = temp;

                // Move both pointers forward
                low++;
                mid++;
            }
            // Case 2: Current element is 1
            else if (nums[mid] == 1) {

                // 1 is already in correct position
                mid++;
            }
            // Case 3: Current element is 2
            else {

                // Swap with element at 'high'
                int temp = nums[mid];
                nums[mid] = nums[high];
                nums[high] = temp;

                // Move 'high' backward
                // Do NOT move 'mid' here because the swapped element needs evaluation
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
